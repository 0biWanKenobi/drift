## 1.3.0
- Moor now supports table joins
  - Added table aliases
- Default values for columns: Just use the `withDefault` method when declaring a column
  - added expressions that resolve to the current date or time
- Fixed a crash that would occur if the first operation was a transaction
- Better support for custom expressions as part of a regular query
- Faster hashcode implementation in generated data classes

## 1.2.0
Changes from the moor and moor_generator libraries:
- __Breaking__: Generated DAO classes are now called `_$YourNameHere`, it used to
be just `_YourNameHere` (without the dollar sign)
- Blob data type
- `insertOrReplace` method for insert statements
- DAOs can now operate on transactions
- Custom constraints
- Query streams are now cached so that equal queries yield identical streams.
  This can improve performance.
- Generated classes now use lazy getters instead of recalculating fields on each access
- Data classes can be converted from and to json
