# moor

Moor is an easy to use, reactive persistence library for Flutter apps. 
Define your database tables in pure Dart and enjoy a fluent query API,
auto-updating streams and more!

This library defines the APIs for the moor persistence library. When using the library,
you'll probably want to use the moor_flutter implementation directly.

Please see the homepage of [moor](https://github.com/simolus3/moor) or
the [moor_flutter package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/moor_flutter) for details
on how to use this package.
