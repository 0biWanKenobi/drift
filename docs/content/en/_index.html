{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-database" title="Prefer SQL? Moor got you covered!" %}}
Moor contains a powerful sql parser and analyzer, allowing it to create typesafe APIs for all your sql queries. All sql queries are
validated and analyzed during build-time, so moor can provide hints about potential errors quickly and generate efficient mapping
code.
