<h4 class="alert-heading">Changes to the recommended implementation</h4>
<p>
Previous versions of this article recommended to use <code>moor_flutter</code> or
the <code>moor_ffi</code> package.
For new users, we recommend to use <code>package:drift/native.dart</code> to open the database - 
more on that below!

<p>
If you have an existing setup that works, there's no need to change anything.

Some versions of the Flutter tool create a broken `settings.gradle` on Android, which can cause problems with `drift/native.dart`.
If you get a "Failed to load dynamic library" exception, see [this comment](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/55827#issuecomment-623779910).
