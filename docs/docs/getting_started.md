{% include content/getting_started.md %}

Congratulations, you now have a class which you can use to easily write queries.
A detailed guide on how to do that is written [here]({{site.url}}/queries/).

PS: You might be asking how you would actually obtain an instance of `MyDatabase` for
your widgets. If so, [here]({{site.url}}/faq/#using-the-database) is some guidance.
