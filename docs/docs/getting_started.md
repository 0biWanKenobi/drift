# Getting started
_Note:_ If you prefer a tutorial video, Reso Coder has made a detailed video explaining
how to get started. You can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/zpWsedYMczM).

Congratulations, you now have a class which you can use to easily write queries.
A detailed guide on how to do that in Dart is written [here]({{"/queries" | absolute_url}}).
If you prefer to write SQL and have moor generate the mapping out, check out
[custom queries]({{"queries/custom" | absolute_url}})

PS: You might be asking how you would actually obtain an instance of `MyDatabase` for
your widgets. If so, [here]({{site.url}}/faq/#using-the-database) is some guidance.
