# Moor documentation
Contains the source code for the moor documentation, live at moor.simonbinder.eu
We use [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy), a Hugo theme for this website. You'll need the extended version of Hugo as described 
[here](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/).

To work on the documentation, first cd into this directory, then run `git submodule update --init --recursive` and
 `npm install`.

## Running the website locally
After the setup, it's just a simple
```
hugo server
```
